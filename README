Hi!

I'm glad to introduce you my first project hosted on github! (=
This project is named fileSphere and is intended to visualize filesystem in some awesome way! Right now it's in early development stage, so wait a little if you want to use it as a finished project.

Uses Irrlicht, http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net, an awesome and lightning-fast 3D renderer.
